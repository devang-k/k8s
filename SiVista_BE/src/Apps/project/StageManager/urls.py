 * Description: StageResult: The URL /result/ will trigger the StageResult view. You would define the logic of this view (likely a class-based view) to return the stage results, likely in some specific format (JSON, HTML, etc.).
                CopyStage1Layouts: The URL /copy/ would be used for the functionality to copy Stage 1 layouts (for example, copying specific layouts from one stage to another).
                GetGDSJPG: The URL /gdsimg/ could be used to return a generated image from a GDS file in JPG format. The GetGDSJPG view would likely contain logic to convert or retrieve the image data from a GDS file.
                DownloadResult: The URL /download/result/ will handle requests to download a result (for example, project results, computations, or data files).
                DownloadGDS: The URL /download/gds/ would allow users to download a GDS file.
