 * File Name: urls.py  
 * Description: This file defines the URL routing configurations for the application. It maps URLs to specific views or functions that handle the HTTP requests. 

                Key sections and functionality include:
                
                1. **URL Patterns**:
                   - This section defines the list of URL patterns that the application recognizes. Each pattern corresponds to a specific view, which is responsible for processing the request and returning an appropriate response.
                   - Patterns can be simple (mapping a URL directly to a view) or more complex (including path parameters, regex patterns, and URL converters).
                
                2. **View Mappings**:
                   - Each URL pattern is associated with a view, which contains the logic to process the request. Views can be functions or class-based views that execute when a request matches a particular URL pattern.
                
                3. **Namespace and Include**:
                   - If the application has multiple modules or apps, `urls.py` can include or namespace URLs from other files. This makes it easy to organize URLs in larger applications and maintain a modular structure.
                   - The `include()` function is typically used to reference the `urls.py` of other apps, allowing each app to manage its own URLs independently.
