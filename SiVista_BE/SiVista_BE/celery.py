 * Description: 1. **Django Settings Module**: This line sets the environment variable for the Django settings module. It's necessary for Celery to use the correct configuration and integrate with Django.
                2. **Celery Application Creation**: This creates the Celery application instance, which is the main object used to configure and manage task execution.
                3. **Loading Configuration from Django Settings**: Celery reads its configuration settings (like broker URL, task serialization, etc.) from the Django `settings.py` file, specifically those prefixed with `CELERY_`.
                4. **Autodiscover Tasks**: This enables Celery to automatically find and register tasks in any of the installed Django apps, making it scalable for complex applications.
                5. **Debug Task**: The `debug_task` is a simple test task, useful for verifying Celery is working correctly.
                This file configures Celery to work seamlessly within the Django application, handling background tasks asynchronously.
